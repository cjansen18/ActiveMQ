This is based on the tutorial of
http://pookey.co.uk/wordpress/archives/74-playing-with-activemq-using-maven

This has 3 seperate Project directories...demonstrating the producer, broker
and Consumer

Start the broker by going into /mq and execute

e.g. /usr/local/Cellar/activemq/5.5.1/ 

execute 'activemq start'

Checkout "http://localhost:8161/admin/"

In the producer directory

mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=net.timico.messaging.App

In the Consumer directory

mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=net.timico.messaging.App
