This is based on the tutorial of
http://pookey.co.uk/wordpress/archives/74-playing-with-activemq-using-maven

This has 3 seperate Project directories...demonstrating the producer, broker
and Consumer

Start the broker by going into /mq and execute

"mvn org.apache.activemq.tooling:maven-activemq-plugin:5.4.2:run"

NOTE: Alternatively....go into the activemq directory (after installing)
e.g. /usr/local/Cellar/activemq/5.5.1/ 

execute 'activemq start'
